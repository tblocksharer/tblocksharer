TBlockSharer
============

The goal of this project is to allow users to share their Twitter block lists with others. Your Twitter block list is
not normally visible publically, and I don't intend to change that. Instead, you will be required to specifically state
who can import your block list to theirs.

A full copy of your block list will be maintained on servers running this software, to allow change tracking and
propogation. Because of this (and the required trust of the server owners), I intend to give clear instructions on how
to set up your own server for this using Microsoft Azure's free tier (website only, no database, and so on). I will be
performing all initial development targetting this environment to ensure it will work there.

Ideas, pull requests, and constructive feedback are all welcomed.
